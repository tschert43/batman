The Joker, in near darkness. Gordon walks in. Sits.
THE JOKER
Evening, Commissioner.
GORDON
Harvey Dent never made it home.
THE JOKER
Of course not.
GORDON
What have you done with him?
THE JOKER
laughs
Me? I was right here. Who did you leave him with? Your people? Assuming, of course, that they are your people not Maroni's...
off look
Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to know how alone you are?
Gordon can't help glancing at the mounted CAMERA.
THE JOKER
Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?
GORDON
Where is he?
THE JOKER
What time is it?
GORDON
What difference does that make?
THE JOKER
Depending on the time, he might be in one spot.
smiles
Or several.
Gordon stands. Moves to the Joker. Undoes his handcuffs.
GORDON
If we're going to play games, I'm going to need a cup of coffee.
THE JOKER
The good cop, bad cop routine?
Gordon pauses, hand on the doorknob.
GORDON
Not exactly.
Gordon steps out. The overhead lights COME ON. BATMAN IS BEHIND HIM. The Joker BLINKS in the HARSH WHITE LIGHT.
WHAM! The Joker's face HITS the table- comes up for air-CRACK! CRACK! To the head. Batman is in front of him. The Joker stares, fascinated. Bleeding.
THE JOKER
Never start with the head... victim gets fuzzy. Can't feel the next-
CRACK! Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker's fingers.
THE JOKER
calm
See?
BATMAN
You wanted me. Here I am.
THE JOKER
I wanted to see what you'd do. And you didn't disappoint...
laughs
You let five people die.
THE JOKER
Then you let Dent take your place. Even to a guy like me... that's cold-
BATMAN
Where's Dent?
THE JOKER
Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth- there's no going back. You've changed things. Forever.
BATMAN
Then why do you want to kill me?
The Joker starts LAUGHING. After a moment he's laughing so hard it sounds like SOBBING.
THE JOKER
Kill you? I don't want to kill you. What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No you...
points
You. Complete. Me.
BATMAN
You're garbage who kills for money.
THE JOKER
Don't talk like one of them- you're not, even if you'd like to be. To them you're a freak like me... they just need you right now.
He regards Batman with something approaching pity.
THE JOKER
But as soon as they don't, they'll cast you out like a leper.
The Joker looks into Batman's eyes. Searching.
THE JOKER
Their morals, their code... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see- I'll show you... when the chips are down, these civilized people... they'll eat each other.
grins
See, I'm not a monster... I'm just ahead of the curve
